		<p>Hello! <br>My name is Anthony and it been a while since I work on my (limited) HTML/CSS skills. I currently work at Apple retail, where I do retail inventory. I have been with the company more than three years now, which has lead me to apply for DevBoocamp.</p>

		<h2 id="container1">Recently</h2>
		<p>I just recently had a great trip to Europe to visit some friends who live there. I visited Milan, Rome, and Florence in Italy but also managed to pop up to Berlin in Germany for a day or two. My Italian has improved and I am now able to proficiently order my own gelato and wine, however my German is still non existent, besides saying <em>danke</em>. </p>

		<h3 id="container1">My favorite applications/softwares to use are: </h3>
		<ul> Illustrator</ul>
		<ul>Photoshop </ul>
		<ul> Sublime</ul>

		<h4 id="container1">Things I want to learn:</h4>
		<li>HTML </li>
		<li>Javascript </li>
		<li><strong>Ruby</strong> </li>
