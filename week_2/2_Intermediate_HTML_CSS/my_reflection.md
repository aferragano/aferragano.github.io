* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I think Web standards are good. It maybe challenging to keep up with changes if they are frequent, however, they are necessary in order for everyone to view the web.

The standard structure does make sense. It makes sense to have all the pages content unified, and layer out. It is a standardized structure that allows people to view pages that easily. Some individuals may find a standard view more accessible.

I think that the HTML5 elements are a great addition to the web. It allows even more structure and identification for web developers. It makes ready code, visualizing, and editing a page much easier. 

The reset.css is necessary because it will layout all the content with out any additionally/ unnecessary styling, so that the page could be viewed by individuals with disabilities. 

The browser I primarily use is Google. I have used mozilla’ firefox and safari, and yes sometimes content does appear different. for the most part, it may only be little things… sometimes font. It isn’t necessary a bad thing that different browsers may view things different, it is just an additionally challenge for programmers and developers to make sure that the page is viewable from any browser.
