# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned that there is a lot more effort than I thought into each individual code. I have a better understanding of how the page interact with the browser, and how to use percentages and em’s. 
I liked the planning. It really does prepare you for many obstacles, however, sometimes when you want something a certain way, it takes a while to figure out how to actually find the result you want. 
I think planning was a great start. I think i should have done more planning in terms of how i wanted to code it. I liked using different colors in illustrator and identify what i wanted everything to be labeled as. It maybe more time consuming, but I think it would have helped me in the long run, because I would get confused with some sections. 
I would like to add more content, and really make it more responsive. For the most part, I believe that it is responsive, however, when the window shrinks very small, some content is forced down. I would want to change the min-width, I think, but I will have to do more research. 
I wasn't exactly hard, using the material I had just learned, however, I did have to reference a lot of material. 
I didn’t find too much that i needed, i did go back to some older references from week one.
