# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

My biggest time management challenge for Phase 0 is that I have a job without consistent scheduling, so it is difficult to time manage without consistent times to work.

I will use a few techniques I have already acquired and use a few that i learned about in this lesson. 

For example, I will time accomplish my goals by starting small. It is easy to be overwhelmed when you have a lot to do, however, if you break up section into smaller tasks it becomes easier to accomplish your overall. I also will use time blocking to manage my time in and out of work. Getting back into the groove of school, I have been viewing each section and their objectives, and planning when I can complete each task by blocking off time on my calendar. Finally using the Pomodoro Technique will prove to helpful to ease frustrations. By tackling something for 25 minutes and giving myself a 5 minute break will alleviate internal pressure. This will also give me time to either solidify or review my progress. 

My overall plan for Phase 0, is to not look too much into the future, so I wonâ€™t get overwhelmed, but to create daily and weekly goals in order to stay on track to being fit for bootcamp!
