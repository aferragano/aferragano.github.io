* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive web design structuring a website so that it will be viewable and accessible on all browsers or devices. Responsive meaning that the webpage will be able to adjust according to the page dimensions given. I like it. It can be challenging, however, I like researching and trying different solutions to a problem. I think a lot has of this should be apart of planning, granted if you do not have a great foundation, you will not know where you may encounter some problems. 
Smart phones and tablets have changed the way we view the internet. Pages were already conducive to finding what you need, or taking as few click possible to get there. Now, with smaller and larger screens, one has to manage how content will be viewed, in relation to website navigation and layout. It has become more elaborate. I think now, all major website will want a specific mobile website to accommodate the mobile user, and maintain their full website for their computer users.
I think it is extremely important to produce websites that are accessible to everyone despite disability. A website is not relevant if it doe snot accommodate everyone including individuals with disabilities. People with a multitude of disabilities are able to use the web, even blind people, which is why is crucial to create a structured website. 
The things that really have resonated have been the accessibility issues. One can tell a good website from a bad one and still have difficulty. A person with a disability may have even more challenges in using a website if it is not coded correctly. Additionally, I am becoming more aware of good code, and trying to use it myself. Working with other people on teams really forces each person to conform to a certain method in order for consistence.
