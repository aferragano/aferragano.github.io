// 5.  ** BONUS **
// not advanced enough for this at this time, but will figure it out soon.

// //  6.  Your Reflection:
// This was a difficult challenge. I wish we had more time in the GPS to 
// accomplish the objectives with the guidance of the instructor. 
// There was a lot of sidetracking during the session, which may have been 
// necessary but maybe too extensive. I would have liked to continue working
// right after the hour session with my partner... or maybe after a short break,
// however, he had previous engagements. We were not able to pair online together
// again after the GPS session, which was detrimental to both of our experiences. 
// I used quite a few resources to get through the challenge on my own. 
// I feel very accomplished that I was able to complete this to the best of my
// ability. (I hope I did everything correctly.)
