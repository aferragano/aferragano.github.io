// Reflection:
// Write your reflection here.....
//'this' refers to the obyect we were primarily using... which was Tharin
// '()' the parenthesis are used to give location on the page
// the semicolons are used to end the line of code, finishing/completing that segment of code

//More reflection:

//This was a really cool exercise! I am so impressed on how many different and 
//fun resources there are online. Some of it was a little silly, but it was a 
//great ice-breaker into  JS. I hope to continue using fun interactive resource 
//like this to continue my education, and really develop my skills. 

//I am excited and a bit nervous for JS. Although this was simple, 
//it was meant to be. I There is SO much more to know!
