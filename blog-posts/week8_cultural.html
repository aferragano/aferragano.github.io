				<h1>Compass of Shame ... and a broken ankle</h1> 
				<h2>The experience I am about to discuss is not a prime example, but one I am willing to share.</h2>

					<p>
					<br>I had a conflict with one of my managers, at what is soon to be, my place of employment(not that this story is the reasoning behind leaving... I just want to code). A manager knowingly disregarded policy in our store to make his job easier. I presented the issue to another manager about this, asking if policy had changed which would account for this increase in apparent negligence. I entered a long discussion of why it was/is necessary, and how I am at fault because I am unable to 'deal with ambiguity.'
					<br><br>Initially, I was outraged, because I wasn't at fault. He manipulated the situation, and tried to manipulate me. Which is interpreted to someone needs to cover their tracks. Fine. Whatever.
					<br><br>He then persisted to email all of my managers, including the district manager, and myself stating how I am unable to 'deal with ambiguity',' and has given me a condescending assignment to survey all of the managers. I was mortified, livid, outraged, embarrassed. There was no need to email the district manager about my development exploited by his laziness. I felt attacked and harassed for doing my job. I shut down. I isolated myself and placed blame on him. It isn't until now I (minutely) consider his side. 
					<br><br>My actions did make the situation worse for myself. I should have approached it differently. I should have approached him directly after (after once again) disregarding policy with email documentation, then presented it to another manager, and then the district manager. 
					<br><br>If I were to go back I would have tried to handle the situation differently, but I also would have filed a harassment complaint for how he handled the situation, not with the intentions getting him fired, just the reassurance that he won't act that way to another employee again. 
					<br><br>I learned a few things from this experience. Open communication is very important. You must be open to discuss with problems or situations with multiple people, multiple managers, and HR, if necessary. Your boss's boss should know your name and like you. Most importantly, trust that most people have good intentions and are able to see good intent.
					<br><br>(Also divine intervention/karma exists. He broke his ankle. I didn't do it. He broke it playing soccer, and has been on leave for the past 3 months. He will not return until after my last day there.)
