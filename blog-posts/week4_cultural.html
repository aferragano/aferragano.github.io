				<h1>TECH GIANTS.</h1> 
				<h2>Is anyone else playing in the tech game? </h2> 
				
					<div id="container">
					<p>We probably know of some tech companies, right? Of course we do. It appears that some tech companies are only getting larger and larger. It almost appears as thought people only have two options, Apple or Microsoft. Which ever you chosen is not important to me. In fact, I think it is great they are choices… however, it is becoming more and more limited as more and more power is gained. 
This is a huge problem. These tech giants are in a league of their own. Not to say that the technology market is a monopoly, it is just extremely difficult to compete with well established companies. Reading some articles, it always fascinates me what is going on with tech culture. Major companies such as Apple and Microsoft have the deep enough pockets to give free storage data to their customers. Not that free cloud storage is hard to come by, however it is more incentive to have seamless compatibility between data and device, and continue the cyclical purchases from the same company. My primary attention, like many people of today, draws attention to mobile devices. Another big company is establishing itself into the tech world. Who would have thought that Amazon would have jumped right on over from their kindle readers to their new phone as the Blackberry maybe fading in the distance.
So what is the problem?
The problem for the industry is that technology companies that want to create and sell hardware and software have to create with the ‘conglomerates of technology,’ who have infinite cash. This makes the market exceptionally competitive to the point that if a company does enter the market, they are likely to be bought out by a giant, and conform to the streamlined ideals of tech giants. There should be more diversity of technology and distribution of technological influence. 
Solutions to alleviate the taxes placed on new companies, and increase those on well established ones or limit the amount of dollar amount of acquisitions of companies annually. <p><br>
