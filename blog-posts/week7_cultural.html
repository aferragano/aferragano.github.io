				<h1>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h1> 
				<h2>confident</h2> 
				
					<div id="container">
					<p>The value that seems to really define how I feel when I am the happiest, proudest or most satisfied would be confident. I struggled to identify which value is most prevalent out of free, serenity, or confident. It is not just the typical sense of the word confident. Yes, I do feel confidence and certainty in my present, but it is more so confidence in the future, almost optimism. It is more so confident, that I am where I am supposed to be, and exemplifying everything is working out, as everything will be okay. <br><br>
					In general, I try to live up to these values: (realistically) 3 out of 5.<br><br>
					The last topic someone asked my advice on was definitely something technology based.   <br><br>
					My confidence is a very important aspect of who I am. I am very self aware and know strengths and weaknesses. I am unconditionally myself. I can't but be who I am, no matter what environment I am in. I think that being myself, and being confident in myself, promotes confidence in others, which will benefit others around me. I think that my personality may target me as stereotypical, but my confidence in myself won't allow it to be an issue. I think that will exude to others, and dissipate the stereotype threat that could exist, but I doubt will. <br><br>
					If I am feeling down at DBC, there is a few things I could/would do besides find some distraction on youtube or buzzfeed. I would take walk or exercise... or just listen to one of my favorite song... and probably sing. Sorry in advance.
