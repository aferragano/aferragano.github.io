				<h1>Pairing and feed back</h1> 
				<h2>Am I contributing? </h2> 
				
					<div id="container">
					<p>I am finally getting used to pairing! I think pairing is a great way to accomplish and learn a lot simultaneously. We don't know everything, but is impressive combining what little knowledge we have, and making it work! This week had awesome pairing partners and sessions. It is always rewarding to accomplish the little challenges, or even making a little progress. <br><br>I do feel a bit inadequate sometimes. The people that I have worked with have been amazing to work with. They have explained things when I was having some trouble. I hope that I am contributing enough to my partner when pair and hope that they are gaining something by pairing with me. I was getting a little frustrated with the code when it wouldn't work my way, or when I was having difficulty explaining how I wanted to tackle a problem. I will increase my knowledge, and hopefully feel more confident in the contributions I make. <br> <br> Feedback is a great outlet to reflect on the pairing session and your partner. I like taking a step back an analyzing the session, my partner, and myself. I think that the feedback that i have received has been accurate. Somethings I already new that I had to work on, such as improving at driver / navigator model. Overall the feed back has been kind, and helpful! <p><br>
