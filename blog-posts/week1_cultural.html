					<p>DBC sounds like a really great learning environment. I am really pleased about the feedback culture that they have adopted into learning environment, because it is more conducive to working/learning together and a great working environment. I am excited to begin learning in this environment, and I already pleased to have met other students who seem great, and helpful. He addressed some of the typical hesitations students have entering DBC, which I am experiencing. I may not be at par with some students, but I am going to expose my ample ignorance, and learn as much as I can, as long as I can.
