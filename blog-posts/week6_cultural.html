				<h1>Stereotyping</h1> 
				<h2>My stories </h2> 
				
					<div id="container">
					<p>In New York I attended Curtis High School. There I wanted to lean all about biology, advancing my way to an AP biology course. As the summer was approaching, a special program was being hosted at the local college based on biology for high school students. It sounded like a great program as the teacher explained it. I was getting excited and was getting ready to sign up... however, there were restriction to apply for the program: you had to be either a minority or female. I am neither of the two. All the other students started filling out their applications... and as I looked around, I was the only one who did not "qualify."" All the other students were minorities or female, and I was the only white male in the class(which was not a rarity in my school). I was frustrated and confused. Granted now, I understand the reasoning or intention of the program, however it was difficult at the time. I was receiving the repercussions of the attempts of rectifying problems associated with race and gender. <br><br>
					Later, in college I attempted to donate blood to the RedCross. I was denied because I am a gay male who has sex with another male since 1955. I was upstate, and already felt isolated, feeling the only gay person. The woman who denied me said "Sorry hun, its not going to be easy." After the blood drive, I was depressed, and upset that the fiber of my being is not acceptable to save another's life. I thoroughly researched the RedCross, and their policies. <br><br>
					So how will I create meaningful feedback or ask for feedback? <br><br>
					Luckily, I have been exposed to a lot of diversity, but also have traveled to places that do not have as much exposure. Stereotyping has no place in a successful working or learning environment. The ideal environment should be safe and accepting. I think that giving feedback to any individual should be presented as unbiased and as sincere, for growth and opportunity with positive intention. Giving the sense of positive intention, potential, and opportunity will have a great effect on the individual. I think the best advice I received during my time in retail was to treat each customer as a family member. I think that this advice is applicable to many scenarios, such as a learning working environment.  <p><br>
