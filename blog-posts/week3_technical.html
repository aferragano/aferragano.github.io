				<h1>JavaScript!</h1> 
				<h2>So why Javascript?</h2> 
					<div id="container">
					<p>Amongst programming languages JavaScript is an excellent language to learn. It is said, that is a relatively easy language to learn. Although I am having some difficulty with itâ€¦ I am surprised on how quickly we are are running through material and how much I am able to pick up and how much is sticking! Additionally, JS is easy to manipulate. These factors alone make it a great language to collaborate with.</p> 
					<br><p>JS has become very popular in the world of development, that each developer requires a basic understanding or knowledge of it. All major browsers have many useful tools in order for developers to test their code or implement into their website. With so many tools and capabilities, it makes it easy to debug or find an error, which saves an invaluable amount of time!</p>
					<br><p>JS is fast and powerful, capable of complicated manipulations.It is asynchronous, meaning that is able to process everything multiple pieces of data simultaneously.  Additionally, it can utilize its many libraries like jQuery to implement or manipulate features on a webpage. </p>
					<br><p>Reading and learning about it, I was able to find some flaws. For example, I read that it only works on the front end, which is great for manipulating pages, but it still relies on other technologies as .Net or PHP, which have more backend capabilities. Some fear that it is not as secure as other languages. JS does have a lot of challenging concepts, as I have looked online.<br>
