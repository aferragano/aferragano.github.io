				<h1>So.. I am abstract random.</h1>

					<p>My learning style is categorized as Abstract Random, which was rather offsetting. After my own self evaluation, I was confused and wondered if I assessed myself correctly(but had a inclination it was true). I was hesitant to embrace this fact. How could an individual with a brain that operates like an abstract Picasso or Matisse painting, compiled with bizarre shapes fused with the randomness of a Pollock, coexist and cooperate in order to learn how to code? Despite my hesitation or disbelief, I recognized after research that it is extremely (and eerily) accurate assessment. </p>

					<p>The Abstract Random mind style is broken down into both abstract and random. Abstract perceptual quality allows individuals to visualize or believe what one actually cannot see. This perception draws upon one's intuition, imagination, while looking for the more subtle implication. Random ordering ability allows an individual to organize information in no particular order, often skipping steps in procedure with the same result. In reading this I must agree that I am and have been skipping around material, a characteristic of random ordering ability.</p>
					<p>The combination of the two results in Abstract Random; These learners like to listen to others, bring harmony to group situation, establish health relationships, and focus on the issue at hand. I've already displayed such characteristics in peering sessions with DBC. Working harmoniously in groups will be vital in achieving group goals and objectives. This is a great asset for to have.</p>

					<p>Abstract Randomer's learn best in a personalized environment, with broad guidelines, maintaing friendly relationships, and able to participate in group activities. DBC already seems like a great environment for establishing and maintaining personal relationships. I have already made friends online with little connection! Some of the assignments are very broad, and can be interpreted multiple ways, however, I feel like it gives more/less freedom to learn.</p>
					<p>According to some articles, I may have difficulty explaining or justifying feelings, competition, working with authoritarian personalities or restrictive environment. I have never been a fan of overly competitive environments, which is something I think I will face when I am out of DBC, looking for a job. Additionally, this type of individual is not typically good at giving exact directions/details. This may have already caused a problem while I was pseudo-coding for one assignment, which I still have to see how it turned out.</p>
