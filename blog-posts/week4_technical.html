				<h1>You make me want to loop baby</h1> 
				<h2>WHILE</h2> 
					<div id="container">
					<p>while. While will execute code while the conditional is true. While the tv is off, I will execute code!</p> 
					<h2>UNTIL</h2> 
					<br><p>until. Until the conditional is false, the code will continue to execute. Until midnight, I will continue to do work.</p>
					<h2>FOR</h2> 
					<br>for. For will execute code once for each element inside an given expression. This one is FOR you, for it is your birthday. Just think of giving someone a gift for their birthday… everyone gets one a year ! </p>
					<h2>BREAK</h2> 
					<br><p>break. Sometimes we all need to take a break. Break will terminate the internal loop. Think of it as a little break before your computer goes to the next code within the code block. </p>
					<h2>NEXT</h2> 
					<br><p>next. Keep walking! Next will go to the next iteration, jumping to the most internal loop. </p>
					<h2>REDO</h2> 
					<br><p>next. Keep walking! Next will go to the next iteration, jumping to the most internal loop. </p>
					<h2>RETRY</h2> 
					<br><p>retry. Can I get another chance? This will appear typically in the block of code near the end, and can be considered the rescue clause. Arguments will be re-evaluated.  </p>
