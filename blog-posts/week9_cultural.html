				<h2>The Golden Rule</h2> 
					<div id="container">
					<p>The best answer to this question is rather entertaining. <strong>"The Golden Rule: Imagine You're Trying to Answer the Question"</strong> found on Jon Skeet's coding blog. A bit obvious, no? However, it makes sense. Thank about when you answer a question and some of the problems you come across. Is the question clear and can it be specifically answered? Is the question too much to read? It is important that the question is concise and direct. This allows for error, miscommunication, or misinterpretation. The more thought that is put into the question, the more thought will be reciprocated in the answer. So write the question, read the question, then re-write the question. Yea, I'm going to say what you are thinking.... refactor your question before you submit.
					<br>Additionally, the question should be tagged appropriately, this will improve the likelihood of receiving the correct answer. Also, if you have the option, utilize the subject line. </p>
					<br><h2>Example please!</h2> <p>It is to articulate what problems you are having but also adding the code may be helpful. Of course, it should only be a few lines of example or a small part of code: no one really wants to proof read all of your code and fix all your problems. Insert your question, and a section of problematic code. Use GitHub if you need an outlet to disply your code, or use Gist on there, and link it to your blog or question forum. 
					<br>check out this link to get more familiar with Gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/aferragano/e7193348e54bac621e8e"> on gist.</a> It really is a useful tool especially if you only want to link or ask only certain people about your code.
