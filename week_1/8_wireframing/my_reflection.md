I didn’t think that design thinking was as practical or methodical. I learned from the experiences from the articles in which, depute their effort of methods, groups changed methods depending on their circumstances to appease a client or deadline. I really like the idea of user experience. I don’t have enough understanding and appreciation for it, but it is a field worth learning more about.
I did enjoy the design aspect of all of this. It I wish I completed this lesson prior to uploading my webpages. I think this would have helped mapping out my pages drastically. 

My question primarily is when to use what kind of model when designing. Is it the preference of the designer most of the time, or the client? I haven’t really found a solution to that question, because I’m sure it is a case-by-case. 
I used illustrator to my advantage, and definitely will wireframe my pages on there when I make my next one. I found out how important the planning stages are, and how to tackle them methodically. 
I am confident from what I leaned in this section. I did enjoy using illustrator and importing images, and mapping out the webpages. I gave me good insight as to the purpose of each section before designing, and after it. 
Some of the wiki reading was a bit tedious and lengthy.
