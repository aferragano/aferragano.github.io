		Hey Anthony & Faraaz,

		Thanks for the email, Anthony.  Looking forward to staying in touch and looking over each other's work!

		So, my name's Alex and I'm based in Southern California right now.  Looking forward to the move to NY! 

		My favorite websites, according to the exercise earlier, include the Wall Street Journal, CodeAcademy, and Cucirca.  

		I have a concrete random method of thinking and a multimodal method of learning!

		Will send you all links to my work as I finish them (almost done).  

		Cheers,

		Alex

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.
