Most of HTML makes sense. I just don't understand the point of not having all CSS sheets externally, it just makes more sense and is more organized.

The good thing about HTML is that it seems mostly anything is possible. I just may take you a while to find a solution to fit your needs. Structuring a webpage is just difficult it seems. 

aha moments.... When i finally correctly linked my HTML to my CSS. I had never become comfortable with that process, seeing how is I rarely hard coded from scratch, but this was a great(slightly longer) exercise for me. 

nothing specifially, just looked around https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML, which seems like it could be a good reference.
