## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: <!-- Blog URL here (remove comment)  -->

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I did enjoy analyzing some websites.... and also learned a bit about myself. I am inherently a direct person or at least thats how I like my websites. I also noticed that I do not get the opportunity to explore as many websites as I would like to. Although my choices are rather boring, they are in fact very useful to me. I am not a great blogger and wish I had more time to create a great blog, which is something i will explore in the future.
