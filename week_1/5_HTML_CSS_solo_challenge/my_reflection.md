The only thing that I really needed some reference on was using a color picker… so I used http://www.colorpicker.com/ . It may sound sill, but it totally useful. Additionally, iI like using this website for color schemes http://colorschemedesigner.com/. I also wanted to use some different web layouts, which are more difficult, but reference them from other website… but I didn't think we were allowed to. 

Some concepts that I was having difficult with was when to use a class or ID, but  I think it is something that, you just need to figure out, and see how many times you will reference it/use it where/when. 

I’ve created some webpages before, but not quite from scratch like this. I feel more comfortable linking my CSS pages to my webpages now. This exercise solidified and expanded on my little knowledge of HTML/CSS.

Comfortable? I feel comfortable in what I know about HTML and CSS, which may not be a lot, and I’m not sure its at the level where is should be for this course. I can create a simple web page from the ground up using basic HTML tags, elements, and CSS. There is still so much to learn. But the material/links given were really helpful and insightful. 

I enjoyed achieving all the goals, and making it about my personality.

I found referencing some things tedious, because I don't have everything memorized yet. I wish I planned out how i wanted the webpage to look, or had more direction on how long we should take/ how much time/effort we should put in to making it look good… or was this just for exercise purposes, for future use when we apply Ruby/Javascript to it.
