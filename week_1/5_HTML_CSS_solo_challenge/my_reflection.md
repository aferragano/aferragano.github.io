During this challenge, the questions I had about headers and footers were answered in http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/working-with-typography/ . This has proven to be an awesome reference! Thank you! 

Concepts that I was having difficulty clarifying the difference between  margins and padding. Playing with my mac website proved to help out with that clarification. 

NEW SKILLS? HECK YEA.
So I solidified some previous knowledge, but also got to measure with %’s and “em”’s so that I get in the habit of potentially creating for multiple platforms. I played around with borders(obviously), and found cool radius techniques to use.   …. is it perfect, NO, but I tried and experimented. 

I actually feel pretty good about the competencies I was to achieve. It does require a bit more practice and constant refreshing, however, I hope I did well. I probably spent way too much time on it. 
I enjoyed creating my own website, and making it “my own.” I enjoyed exploring my own avenues of creativity.

I wish I mapped out more of what i wanted to produce instead of only a little bit of planning. Although I think I did learn a lot more this way, I feel like I may have focused on somethings a bit too much. Additionally, I wasn’t sure to what extent I should I have taken this challenge.
