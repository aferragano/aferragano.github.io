I learned the difference between Domain and IP address. Domain is the actually english name, we, people use to access certain site from the web, where as the computer must use the IP address to find the website and bring it to our computer. I now know that there is a DNS, domain system, which is essentially a phonebook for Domain systems and IP addresses.

When setting up HTML, you always have to have your index page as the home page.
You have to keep you Domain Name/IP address updated if ever you change web servers or IP addresses.

Seeing the page live definitely gives a sense of accomplishment. (the GitHub application is soooo much nicer than using terminal!! ! ! !  I wish I knew about it sooner.)

An aha moment…. May not be all that astonishing, but it is very important. The slide in which talks about accessibility says “Accessibility is a continuum, NOT a checkbox.” I think this is very important to keep in mind. There can always be improvements to broaden the potential audience of a website, and it is up to us to perpetually improve.

In addition to my aha moment with accessibility, I was given a few tips and tricks by a friend on how to my a website more accessible. One example for some individuals with possible motor skill impairments, is to navigate your website with your mouse upside down. This is challenging, but also allows you to see if you are able to click on buttons with ease.

will this up load? i have no idea!!!!! fingers crossed!
